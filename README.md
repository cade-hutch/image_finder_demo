**Using python 3.11.5**

STEP 1:  
Go to [imagefinderdemo2.streamlit.app](https://imagefinderdemo2.streamlit.app/)

STEP 2:  
Create and submit OpenAI api key

STEP 3:  
Upload selection of images, then click the submission button to kick off descritpion generation.

- The submitted API Key will store your uploads so searches can be done for prior uploads.
- Recommend 20-50 images for a good sample size and an average image size of less than 10MB to keep API costs low.
- Depending on upload speed and images size, range for each generation time should be around 10-30 seconds.

STEP 4:  
After successful description generation, images can be searched for by entering a search query.

NOTES: Some output will still be in terminal, currently working to display everything in app.
